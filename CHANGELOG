2024.15.05 Released as spamhole-ng
    Rewrote sections of spamhole.c for safety and compilation on modern GCC.

2003.12.10	Released as version 0.5.

		Essentially re-wrote most of the source to remove the option
		to allow connection passthrough to a real smtp server and
		added a lightweight smtp server emulator.

		Moved the initialization code to an init() subroutine.

		Moved the configuration options to config.h

2003.12.09	Released as version 0.4.

		Added creation of working dir if it does not exist upon
		startup.

		Applied patch from Kees Cook @ Open Source Development Lab
		<kees@osdl.org> which added support for binding to a defined
		network address as well as cleaned up the compiler warnings.

		John Delisle <John_Delisle@ceridian.ca> contributed a startup
		script for RedHat-ish distro users.  It can be found in the
		'contrib' directory.

2003.12.08	Released as version 0.3.

		Moved decision to spamhole messages outside the check for
		previous connections.  Previously, the first connection
		which initialized the counter would always pass the connection
		without modification even if the threshold was set to 0.

2003.12.04	Fixed counter reset bug.  Counter no longer resets at 100.
